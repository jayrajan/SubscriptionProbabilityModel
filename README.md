# SUBSCRIPTION PROBABILITY MODEL
Using machine learning to develop models that is capable of predicting customer
subscription based on current dataset

The dataset is composed of 21 variables: [20 independent (X) & 1 dependent(y)]

* The code analyses the spread of the current dataset
* Calculates the correlation between the input datasets and the output dataset
* Identifies 5 most correlated x(i) variable to y
* Model 1 - Linear regression model using 20 inputs
* Model 2 - Linear regression model using 5 most correlated input to 'y'
* Splits the data set to Training and Test Data set with a ratio of 9:1
* Evaluates the accuracy of the machine models


## PREREQUISITIE:
1. The program is scripted in Python3. Have the correct version of
  python installed
2. Please ensure you have following libraries installed:
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * scipy
  * sklearn
3. Please have the following files in the same directory as main.py
  * data set.csv

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Load Terminal
2. Set current directory to the folder containing the main.py file.
3. Run script from a Terminal. Type python3 main.py
4. The plots generated by the code will be saved in the same directory
   as main.py file.
